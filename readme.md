# Socketify

_Java NIO Sockets Helper Library_

Creating a server and a client which uses sockets in Java is a little bit 
confusing, so to make things easier for you and me, I made this helper
library!

You've got a suggestion or issue with this library? File it 
[here](https://github.com/bmdelacruz/Socketify/issues)!

## Documentation

I'm still doing it! Comeback and read it later. \*wink wink\*
